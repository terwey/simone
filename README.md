# Simone

Simone is a responsive modern design theme designed and developed by
[Morten Rand-Hendriksen](http://mor10.com) and ported to Bolt by Bob den
Otter.

**Note:**  This is for Bolt 3. Check out the `bolt-v2` branch for a Bolt 2 compatible version.

Simone's design is focused on typography and aims to put the content front
and center. Fonts are large and clear and scale according to screen width.
On wider screens blockquotes and images can be aligned left and right to
break out of the main stream and get a pull-quote effect. The featured
images are responsive through the use of the <picture> element resulting
in appropriate image sizes being loaded to fit individual screen sizes.


### Customizing options
